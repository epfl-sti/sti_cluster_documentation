# Project team

No project could exist without anyone to move it forward.
Even though, this project is not entirely based on the scrum methodology, the various roles are coming from it: <https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/roles-scrum>.

The project is composed of the following persons:

| Person                                                            | Role                                                                      |
