# Objectives

Due to an increasing need for computation at the School of Engineering, we have decided to launch a school dedicated computing cluster.

Given it a harduous task, we have decided to join the IC cluster and leverage their expertise on the topic. Therefore, our current machines are hosted within the IC cluster.

Doing so provides several benefits such as:

* reusing an existing infrastructure
* leverage the expertise from the IC team
* not reinventing the wheel

For the time being, the objectives of the project are the following:

* provide a computing environment where customers from the School of Engineering will:
  * be able to connect to the provided machines
  * find the packages they require already installed
  * have access to their personal files (through their home drive)
  * have access to any shared (across their lab) folder (through the NAS service provided by IS)

In order to achieve those objectives, the project has been split in [various steps](project_steps).
