# Objectives

Due to an increasing need for computation at the School of Engineering, we have decided to launch a school dedicated computing cluster.

Given it is a harduous task, we have decided to join the IC cluster and leverage their expertise on the topic. Therefore, our current machines are hosted within the IC cluster.

Doing so provides several benefits such as:

* reusing an existing infrastructure
* leverage the expertise from the IC team
* not reinventing the wheel

Moreover, in line with the [Strategic plan 2021-2014](https://inside.epfl.ch/ae/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/EPFL_StratPlan_2021_2024_EN.pdf), regarding energy and sustainability, the EPFL strategy is to go towards offering mutual services and resources that the research community can use as they need. The datacenter 2021 project will further align this strategy with objectives and plans. The School of Engineering would like to already start moving in this direction in order to gather a certain maturity with regards to service definition and challenges.
The main vision of this project is to be able to provide the various research groups with ‘personalized’ exclusive computing resources for a limited amount of time on a pay-per-use basis.

For the time being, the objectives of the project are the following:

* provide a computing environment where customers from the School of Engineering will:
  * be able to connect to the provided machines
  * find the packages they require already installed
  * have access to their personal files (through their home drive)
  * have access to any shared (across their lab) folder (through the NAS service provided by IS)

In order to achieve those objectives, the project has been split in [various steps](project_steps).
